# StreamNation
StreamNation is a mini project that aims to recreate the basic functionalities of a streaming platform like Netflix using React and Firebase. This project allows users to browse and watch movies or TV shows, manage their watchlist, and rate their favorite content.

# Features
## User authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out. Firebase Authentication is used to handle user authentication and session management.

## Movie and TV show database: StreamNation integrates with a movie and TV show API (e.g., The Movie Database) to fetch a collection of movies and TV shows. Users can browse the available content, view details, and watch trailers.

## Watchlist: Users can add movies or TV shows to their watchlist to keep track of the content they want to watch later.

## Ratings: Users can rate movies or TV shows and provide feedback on their viewing experience.

# Technologies Used
## React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create the frontend components and handle user interactions.

## Firebase: A cloud-based platform that provides various backend services. Firebase Authentication is used for user authentication, and Firestore is used as the NoSQL database to store user data.

## Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that helps in rapidly building custom user interfaces. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface and creating a visually appealing design.
